Simulation:
    Name: "Energy community demo"
    Description: "This scenario describes the behavior of a small rural energy community of four detached houses. The houses have no controllable loads or storages but two of them have a small scale PV systems installed and one has a electric vehicle charging. Scenario spans over one day with hourly resolution (epochs)."
