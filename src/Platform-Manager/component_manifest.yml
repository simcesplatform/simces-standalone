# Template for the component manifest file for registering a component to the simulation platform

# The file is in YAML format. Note that the indentation is important.
# The file should be but into the root folder of the repository containing the source code of the component.

# Name is required attribute for all components.
# It is used to identify the component type when specifying simulations.
Name: "my_component"

# Type is required attribute for all components.
# The accepted values are "platform" for the platform managed components and
# "external" for externally managed components.
Type: platform

# DockerImage is required attribute for platform managed components.
# For externally managed components it is ignored.
# The value should be the name of the Docker image that contains the simulation component.
DockerImage: ghcr.io/simcesplatform/my_component_image

# Description is an optional attribute which can contain a description of the component to the simulation platform.
Description: "My simulation component"

# Attributes is an optional attribute but if it is not given the Platform Manager
# cannot do any checking for the parameters when starting new simulation runs.
# - The attributes should contain the definitions for those starting attributes that are defined in
#   the Start message block documentation for the component in question.
# - The attribute definitions are given as key-value list.
# - Each attribute defined for the component can have the following sub attributes:
#   - Optional: true/false
#     - If true, the attribute can be left out when defining a new simulation run.
#     - if false, a simulation cannot be started without giving a value for this attribute.
#     - By default the attribute is set as required, i.e. Optional is set to false.
#   - Default: <the_default_value_for_the_attribute>
#     - If the default value is set, it is used as the attribute value in cases where the attribute
#       is not given a value in the simulation configuration.
#   - Environment: <the_environment_variable_name>
#     - Ignored for externally managed components.
#     - If this is given, the corresponding value is used as the environment variable name instead of
#       the attribute name when passing the starting parameters to a platform managed component.
#   - IncludeInStart: true/false
#     - Whether to include the attribute value in the Start message.
#     - By default the attribute will be included in the Start message, i.e IncludeInStart is set to true.
# - Any attribute that is given a value in the simulation configuration file for a new simulation will be included
#   among the parameters in the Start message (and as environment variable for platform managed component).
#   - This allows extending the available starting parameters for a component without updating the manifest file
#     but this feature should only be used during the development phase.
#   - No checking is done for any of the "undocumented" attributes.

# some examples about defining the starting attributes are given below
Attributes:

    # a required starting attribute "AttributeName1" which is passed as the environment variable "ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_1"
    AttributeName1:
        Optional: false
        Environment: ATTRIBUTE_NAME_1

    # an optional starting attribute "AttributeName2" with a default value of 123 and
    # is passed as the environment variable name "ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_2"
    AttributeName2:
        Optional: true
        Default: 123
        Environment: ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_2

    # a required starting attribute "AttributeName3",
    # if used with platform managed component the environment variable name will also be "AttributeName3"
    AttributeName3:

    # an optional starting attribute "AttributeName4" with a default value of "my_value",
    # if used with platform managed component the environment variable name will also be "AttributeName4"
    AttributeName4:
        Optional: true
        Default: "my_value"
