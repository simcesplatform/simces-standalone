### Message classes

[`tools/messages.py`](tools/messages.py)

- Contains message classes that can be used to handle messages in the simulation platform.
- The message classes contains some validation for the message attribute values and the creation of message objects will fail, by throwing an exception, if some attribute has an invalid value.
- The timestamps for the message objects are generated automatically if the timestamp is not explicitly given.
- The actual implementations for the message classes can be found in the folder `tools/message/` but the main file can be used to simplify import calls.
    - For example, `from tools.messages import StatusMessage` is equivalent to `from tools.message.status import StatusMessage`
- Currently supported message types (more supported message types can be found from [domain-messages](https://github.com/simcesplatform/domain-messages) repository):
    - `BaseMessage` (defined in [tools/message/abstract.py](tools/message/abstract.py))
        - Message object that contains only Type, SimulationId and Timestamp
        - Log Writer can handle any message that contains at least these three attributes.

- Common methods for all message classes:
    - `__init__` (constructor)
        - Takes in all the arguments as defined in the wiki pages for the message.
        - Any additional arguments that are not part of the message definition are ignored.
        - Does some validity checks for the attribute values and throws an exception if at least one value was found to be invalid. For example, the EpochNumber must be a non-negative integer.
    - `from_json` (class method)
        - Returns a new message instance if the `json_message` contains valid values for the message type. Returns None, if there is at least one invalid value or missing required attribute.
        - Can be used instead of the constructor to avoid exception handling. However, direct use of the constructor is faster during runtime.

## How to include simulation-tools to your own project

NOTE: If you intend to use [domain-messages](https://github.com/simcesplatform/domain-messages)
you do not have to include simulation-tools separately since domain-messages already includes it.
Use the [instructions](https://github.com/simcesplatform/domain-messages/blob/master/README.md#how-to-include-domain-messages-to-your-own-project) at domain-messages instead of these when using domain-messages.

These instructions try to take into account the problems arising from the fact that the GitLab server uses self signed SSL certificate. Two optional ways of including simulation-tools are described here.

- Manual copy of the tools folder

    - The easiest way to get the most recent version of the library.
    - No easy way of checking if there are updates for the library code. For a work in progress library this is a significant downside.

    Installation instructions:
    - Clone the simulation-tools repository:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/simcesplatform/simulation-tools.git
        ```

    - Copy the `tools` folder from simulation-tools repository manually to the root folder of your own Python project.
    - Start using the library. For example the RabbitMQ client class can be made available by using:

       ```python
       from tools.clients import RabbitmqClient
       ```

- Using simulation-tools as a Git submodule in your own Git repository
    - Allows an easy way to update to the newest version of the library.
    - Requires the use of Git repository (some kind of version control is always recommended when working source code).
    - Requires more initial setup than manual copying.
    - For example, simulation-manager repository is including the library as a Git submodule.

    Installation instructions:
    - In the root folder of your Git repository add simulation-tools as a Git submodule

        ```bash
        # run this from the root folder of your Git repository
        git submodule add -b master https://github.com/simcesplatform/simulation-tools.git
        git submodule init
        git submodule update --remote
        ```

    - The simulation-tools folder should now contain a copy of the simulation-tools repository with the library code found in the `simulation-tools/tools` folder. To enable similar way of importing library modules as is used in the library itself or when using the manual copy of the tools folder, the Python interpreter needs to be told of the location of the tools folder. One way to do this is to use the init code from simulation-tools:
        1. Copy the init folder from simulation-tools to the root folder of your code repository:

            ```bash
            # run this from the root folder of your Git repository
            cp -r simulation-tools/init .
            ```

        2. Include a line `import init` at the beginning of the Python source code file from where your program is started. E.g. if your program is started with `python master.py` or `python -m master` include the import init line at the `master.py` file before any imports from the simulation-tools library.
            - Another way to avoid modifying your source code would be to include the import init line in `__init__.py` file as has been used for example in the [Simulation Manager repository](https://github.com/simcesplatform/simulation-manager/tree/master/manager).
    - Start using the library. For example the RabbitMQ client class can be made available by using:

       ```python
       from tools.clients import RabbitmqClient
       ```

    - To update the simulation-tools library to the newest version, run:

        ```bash
        # run this from inside your Git repository (but not from the simulation-tools folder)
        git submodule update --remote
        ```

## How to add support for a new message type as a Python class

Assumption is that the new message type is based on AbstractResult message.

There are some examples available:

- The Python class for [Epoch](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/Epoch) message can be found at [tools/message/epoch.py](tools/message/epoch.py)
- The Python class for [Status](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/Status) message can be found at [tools/message/status.py](tools/message/status.py)
- The Python class for Example message type can be found at [tools/message/example.py](tools/message/example.py). This example message type is made as an example of a message that adds some attributes to the AbstractResult message type with some of the attributes using the [Quantity block](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/Quantity+block) or [Time series block](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=tuniSimCES&title=Time+series+block) as the attribute values.

A template for a new message type is given at [`message_template.txt`](message_template.txt).

- The current implementation of the message classes is quite verbose but a template is provided to make it easier for the development of new message classes.
- All `<message type>`, `<property name 1>`, ... should be replaced with the appropriate names for the new message. For example `<message type>` for a NetworkState.Current message could be NetworkStateCurrentMessage.
- Attributes containing [Quantity blocks](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/Quantity+block) as attributes have special support. However, no such support exists yet for [Quantity array block](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/Quantity+array+block) or [Time series block](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/Time+series+block).
- Existing message classes can be used as examples when implementing new message classes.
- Overview of what is required from a new message class for it to be compatible with the existing message classes:
    - Set the class constants `CLASS_MESSAGE_TYPE`, `MESSAGE_TYPE_CHECK`, `MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES`, `OPTIONAL_ATTRIBUTES`, `QUANTITY_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES`, `TIMESERIES_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES`, `MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES_FULL`, `OPTIONAL_ATTRIBUTES_FULL`, `QUANTITY_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES_FULL` and `TIMESERIES_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES_FULL` with the instructions given in the template.
    - Add a property getter for each new attribute in the message (those attributes that don't belong to [AbstractResult](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/AbstractResult)).
    - Add a property setter for each new attribute in the message (those attributes that don't belong to [AbstractResult](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuniSimCES/AbstractResult)).
    - Add a check function (with a name of `"_check_<property name>"` for each property that checks the validity of the given value. This can be very general in some cases. For example, "isinstance(value, str) and len(value) > 0" would ensure that "value" is a non-empty string.
    - Add a new implementation for the equality check method `"__eq__"`.
    - Add a new implementation for the "from_json" method. This is only for the return value type for the use of Python linters, not for any actual additional functionality.
    - Add a call to the `register_to_factory` method after the message class definition.

## General instructions for creating a new simulation component

When implementing a new simulation component in Python it is advisable to try to use the abstract simulation component class as the base class and implement the new simulation component as its child class. Some of the general workflow required from a component participating in a simulation run has already been implemented for the abstract class. The already implemented simulation components can be used as an example for using the abstract component as a base. Some general instructions are given here. There is also a template file, [examples/component_template.py](examples/component_template.py), that can be used as a starting point when implementing a new component.

- Import the abstract component class to the project: `from tools.components import AbstractSimulationComponent`
- Make a new class that is a child of the abstract class: `class MyComponent(AbstractSimulationComponent)`
- Overwrite the constructor, `__init__`
    - Add new arguments as needed. Remember to call the parent class constructor with the appropriate parameters at the beginning of the new constructor: `super().__init__(<abstract_component_parameters>)`
    - Add any initialization needed code to the new constructor. This includes initialization of any new object variables that are needed. For example, `self._received_messages` variable could be used to store all the input messages for the current epoch and initialized to an empty list in the constructor.
- Overwrite the `clear_epoch_variables` method
    - This method is automatically called after receiving an Epoch message for a new epoch. It should clear and initialize all the variables that are used to store information about the received input data within each data.
    - For example, if `self._received_messages` variable is used to store all the received input messages from the other components for the current epoch, this method would include setting that variable to an empty list.
- Overwrite the `general_message_handler` method
    - Handling of all incoming messages other than Epoch or SimState messages should be added here.
    - After handling the incoming message call `start_epoch` method unless it is clear that the component is not yet ready to do any calculations for the current epoch.
- Overwrite the `all_messages_received_for_epoch` method
    - This method should return True only if all the necessary information is available for the component to process the current epoch.
    - The use of additional object variables, initialized in the constructor, is almost certainly necessary to achieve the required checks.
- Overwrite the `process_epoch` method
    - This method is automatically called by `start_epoch` if the component is ready to process the current epoch. Usually it should not be called directly from user-added code.
    - Add all the calculations that are needed for processing the epoch here.
    - Add sending of any result messages here.
    - Return True if the component is fully finished with the current epoch and will not be sending any other result messages after this. Return value True will automatically trigger the sending of Status ready message from this component.
    - Return False if the component can do further processing within the current epoch.
- If required, add other changes or overwrites to the abstract component class.
    - Usually these should not be needed.

## How to use the example code

- Message class examples, [`examples/messages.py`](examples/messages.py)
    - Contains some examples on how create and use the message classes.
    - The default Python interpreter can be used to run the test code (run `python` or `python3` from the the project root):

        ```python
        from examples.messages import *

        test_from_json()            # examples on creating message objects from JSON
        test_invalid_status()       # examples on trying to create status messages with invalid input
        test_message_generator()    # examples on creating messages using the message generator helper class
        test_timeseries_from_csv()  # examples on creating TimeSeriesBlock objects from CSV files
        ```

- Message bus client examples
    - Contains an example on how to create an instance of the RabbitmqClient that can be used to send and receive messages to and from the message bus, [`examples/client.py`](examples/client.py).
    - Contains examples on how to send messages to the message bus using the RabbitmqClient class, [`examples/client_send.py`](examples/client_send.py).
    - Contains an example on how to receive and handle messages incoming from the message bus using the RabbitmqClient class, [`examples/client_receive.py`](examples/client_receive.py).
    - To start the message receiver example (from the command line):

        ```python
        python -u -m examples.client_receive
        ```

    - To start the message sender example (from the command line):

        ```python
        python -u -m examples.client_send
        ```

- The Timer class examples, [examples/timer.py](examples/timer.py)
    - Contains a couple of examples on how to start timed tasks with or without extra parameters.
    - To start the timer example (from the command line):

        ```python
        python -u -m examples.timer
        ```

## Things not yet covered here

- Test code or how to write unit tests for new message classes or other tools based on the common code.
- How to use the code library or your own code with Docker.

## Run unit tests for the simulation-tools library

```bash
docker network create tools_test_network
docker-compose -f rabbitmq/docker-compose-rabbitmq.yml up --detach
docker-compose -f mongodb/docker-compose-mongodb.yml up --detach
# Wait a few seconds to allow the local RabbitMQ message bus to initialize.
docker-compose -f docker-compose-tests.yml up --build
```

## Clean up after running the tests

```bash
docker-compose -f rabbitmq/docker-compose-rabbitmq.yml down --remove-orphans
docker-compose -f mongodb/docker-compose-mongodb.yml down --remove-orphans
docker-compose -f docker-compose-tests.yml down --remove-orphans
docker network rm tools_test_network
```
